## A Very basic tutorial for a new user

> [!important] 
> New versions of Photoshop may not look the same as these screen images.
 
### Do this first

Turn off those annoying pop videos. 

![Removehelp.png](../../media/Removehelp.png.png)

### First set this up and add to the menu bar

- You can move the tools to where you like.

The toolbar looks like this as a default:

![Photoshop Tools](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2014.35.18.png)

But you can add more tools to this bar

![Adding tools](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2014.37.19.png)

![More tools](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2014.40.41.png)

All windows and actions are under the Window menu, but you can make sure that frequently used panels are available through your custom set up.

On the top right you will see some provided workspaces:

> [!important] 
> But you can create your own 

Organise your spaces; here is an example:

You minimise the panels so you just see the icons and this gives you more space.

Then you can save your workspace to get it back later...

### The workshop / exercise

> [!tip] 
> This tutorial is designed to show how to use layers, subject selection, masking and adding text. 

We need these 2 files - get them from [here](https://notes.chrisjennings.net/media/photoshopfiles/einstein-on-the-beach.zip)


![Beach Scene and Tom Conti playing Einstein in the film _Oppenheimer_](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.05.16.png)

First we will start a new Photoshop file and create a new file. For use in Instagram we should use a square, but we can always crop this afterwards.

![A4 Photoshop file](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.08.00.png)

>Save this somewhere.

Now _Place_ (on the File menu use embedded) the beach scene image.

Resize to fit... and then click to confirm

![Resize with the handles](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.13.12.png)

Place Embedded  the einstein image and position at the bottom

![Now the next image](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.15.31.png)

#### Duplicate that layer and name it

Hide the original layer (click the eye icon) and create an adjustment layer below the new copy and choose solid color with any solid bright color.

![Notice the layers](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.19.58.png)

### Getting rid of the background

There is more than one way to do this but here is my method:

With the top layer selected go to the Select menu item and choose _Select and Mask_

![Select and Mask](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.25.07.png)

This panel may look different for you; please use these settings but do not press OK yet.

Find the **Select Subject** at the top and first choose the Detailed Results and then click Select Subject

![Select](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.28.54.png)

Here is what we should see

![Masked](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.31.47.png)

You can now click the _Refine Hair_ button and this will make a difference to the detail around the hair.

Make sure that the Properties Panel shows _New Layer with Mask_ and then click OK

![Final step](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.35.52.png)

You might need to use the Eraser tool to remove any remains of the background.

Hide the Color Fill Layer and we have _Einstein on the Beach_. You can move him around as you like.

![Einstein on the Beach](../../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2015.37.51.png)

## Adding Text

First we create a text box with the text tool. (T in the tools) and then replace the Lorem iprum text with _Einstein on the Beach_

We can change the typeface though the Properties panel

![Typeface](../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2016.11.28.png)

### Maximum Flexibility

Now we are going to use this text separated out into 3 lines by copying and pasting 2 more copies. We can do this by dragging the layer onto the + sign

![3 Layers for text](../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2016.15.32.png)

Now we need to change the type size and arrange the 3 lines

![The text is resized](../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2016.20.37.png)

### Contrast is important for readability

So now we can use the Effects panel to add an outline (Outer Glow) where needed.

![Effects](../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2016.22.43.png)

We see here that word goes over the head...

![Over the head](../../media/Screenshot%202024-02-08%20at%2016.23.40.png)

But we can reorder the layers and put the text under the head and even change the colour...
