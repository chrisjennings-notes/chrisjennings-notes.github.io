## Introduction
Various articles and presentations can be found here.

## This site - how did I do it?
This site is published from a GitHub repository using the [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)  static site generator with the *[Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)* Theme. I have modified this quite a bit and added some plugins to make it work better.

### How do I write and publish?
Hereâ€™s the clever thing - I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write the pages and then use the Git extension to _Push_ the pages up to GitHub which then generates the page.

This content was originally published on my publisha.org site.
