**Design and Production Techniques Where Both Print Book and eBook Are Required**

The eBook uses the example of a Shakespeare Play with introductory text and images as well as some sample multimedia. The sample eBook isÂ **built 3 ways**; as a Reflowable ePUB, a Fixed-Layout ePUB and a multi-touch eBook using iBooks Author.

	Built with iBooks Author

> [!note] 
>  I recently had to change the title and subtitle to conform to title case rules with Apple. Title case rules should conform to those recommended in '[The Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.pagetoscreen.net/ebooks/books/item/chicago_manual_of_style.html)'
