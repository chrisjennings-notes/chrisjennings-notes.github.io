So, edition is equivalent to version in meaning, although only publicly available, not within the editorial workflow. We have only seen the term version used in one place, The Elements of Typographic Style, Robert Bringhurst, 2012.</p> <p>Revise may be used to indicate a stage in the editorial process as in revise 1, revise 2. Some publishers may also use revised edition on the imprint page as a way to indicate improvement.</p> <p>Impression is a term used to indicate a new printing. The term is rarely used on the imprint page, although you will see in the illustration here that OUP have recently replaced the impression sequence numbers with the term Impression 4.</p> <p>A Reprint may be the same book but with some changes, although unless you see something like \"with a new preface by ...\", then you may not know. A reprint could be same content but reset with new type. It is different from a facsimile which is an exact copy (page-by-page), often used to re-publish legacy content that can only be taken from printed pages.</p> <p>Errata are corrections to a book when it has already been printed. The corrected errors are printed on a slip of paper and then glued into the front matter of the book before distribution.

On the other hand, popular titles (see here 'Treasure Island'), will have many reprints and new editions up to the date of the edition you have. Many reprints could be an indication of the popularity of the title, although imprint pages do not tell us how many were printed. One could argue that many reprints show that the publisher was not confident enough for a longer print run in the first place.</p> <p>Figure 2: Winnie the Pooh</p> <p>As an alternative to taking a lot of space on the page, you see here from the 1949 edition of Winnie the Pooh, that it had been reprinted 38 times before this \"Thirty-ninth edition\". This seems to be a misinterpretation of the term \"edition\", since a reprint is not usually regarded as a new edition.</p> <p>Impression Lines are a string of numbers on the imprint page, that are incrementally erased, to show the current printing. It is interesting again, to flip over the title pages of our books to see this little cryptic message that is there for us to interpret. The publisher needs to first decide the highest number, because this suggests how many reprints might possible happen; a pessimism / optimism indicator, I suppose.</p> <p>For each printing the lowest number is erased.</p> <p>Figure 3: A Harper Collins imprint page</p> <p>The convention is different in the USA; publishers there tend to include the date as well as the impression number.</p> <p>Figure 4: A publication from a USA Publisher</p> <p>You will see in the illustrations here that Oxford University Press have used impression numbers, and the popular Economics title in their Very Short Introductions series has lost all numbers 1 through 8, an indication that my copy is the 9th printing.</p> <p>Figure 5: Animal Rights - OUP, Very Short Introductions</p> <p>Figure 6: Economics - OUP, Very Short Introductions</p> <p>Oxford University Press have followed this convention until their Microeconomics title, in this same series.

For example, if we want a 16pt first line indent, then we enter this in and InDesign will convert to an exact millimetre size.</p> <p>Note: If you read any of the Adobe Classroom books on InDesign, the units there are in Picas.

This character style is merely a named style, it does not need to be used to present a different appearance.</p> <p>Figure 10: Using the text variables from a character style</p> <p>Once the character style has been created it is very easy to use the <code>search/replace</code>method to look for the paragraph styles (scene and firstscene) and then replace the found content with the new character style. This character style can then be used as a new variable alongside our variable for the Act. The headings <code>scene</code> and <code>firstcene</code> will then have both a paragraph and a character style applied.</p>","tags":["indesign","typography"]},{"location":"InDesign/Master-or-Parent-Pages-in-InDesign/#overriding-master-page-items","title":"Overriding Master Page Items","text":"<p>There are some situations where you want to remove the master page items on a particular page.

We can add this back in using a border in the CSS. More on this later. If you use the underline rather than rule, this will appear in the ePub, but without any offset or colour change.</li> <li>Footnotes This won\u2019t be ignored and we can use these to create \u2018popup\u2019 notes.</li> <li>Orphans and Widows These are controlled using the Keep Options and they will not be ignored, however, the concept of orphans and widows is not supported by any eReader software that we know currently.

In my book I have a portrait of Shakespeare in an oval shape with the edge of the text following the curve. Our eBook version simply stops the text either side of this image.</li> <li>And more...

The ePUB3 Media\u00a0Overlays specification does not get the support it deserves at the moment, so it can be problematic getting this to work properly.</p> <p>If we use the current method that InDesign provides for exporting the the ePUB(fixed-layout) form, then each word in the HTML is marked-up with a span tag. Now, actually, this is exactly what we need for read-aloud, but then we are committed to highlight every word and also analyse our audio to pick out every word. We will find it very difficult to change the HTML markup to tag each line instead.</p> <p>The basic principle is that each word spoken and written needs to relate to a time sequence within a longer audio file. A SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) file is constructed so as to mirror the text that is then marked up with the appropriate tags that will tell the text on screen what to highlight as the audio plays.</p> <p>Building something like this by hand coding would be virtually impossible for the whole of the play, and would also depend on the level of granularity that you want to be highlighted; word, line, sentence, or paragraph etc.</p> <p>Figure 5: Here we see the complex markup</p> <p>Here we see that the audio section that we will use start \u2018Four nights \u2026\u2019 with the span tag <code>id=\"_idTextSpan207\"</code></p> <p>We now need to construct a SMIL file that uses the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>&lt;smil xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/SMIL\" xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" version=\"3.0\"&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;seq id=\"s000001\" epub:textref=\"dream-05.xhtml\"&gt;\n&lt;par id=\"par1\"&gt;\n&lt;text src=\"dream-05.xhtml#_idTextSpan207\"/&gt;\n&lt;audio src=\"audio/act1scene1_clip01.mp3\" clipBegin=\"0.000000s\" clipEnd=\"2.214817s\" /&gt;\n&lt;/par&gt;\n&lt;par id=\"par2\"&gt;\n&lt;text src=\"dream-05.xhtml#_idTextSpan208\"/&gt;\n&lt;audio src=\"audio/act1scene1_clip01.mp3\" clipBegin=\"2.214817s\" clipEnd=\"4.062584s\" /&gt;\n&lt;/par&gt;\n&lt;par id=\"par3\"&gt;\n&lt;text src=\u201cdream-05.xhtml#_idTextSpan209\u201d/&gt;\nand so on \u2026.\n&lt;/seq&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/smil&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>You might consider using regular expressions to help with this task.

I can then use this base file to reconstruct the <code>SMIL</code> tags.</p> <p>The next challenge is how to identify all of the clip ranges inside the audio file. For this we need the marvellous free audio editor \u2018Audacity\u2019.</p> <p>Audacity can help us build a clip sequence by using a label track:</p> <p>Figure 6:  Audacity can help locate words spoken within the audio file</p> <p>Then we can export the labels and we get:</p> <p></p><pre><code>3.051281 3.379623 Four\n3.375440 3.549022 Nights\n3.546931 3.820898 will\n3.818807 4.172245 quickly\n4.170154 4.448303 dream\n4.446212 4.596789 away\n4.590515 4.747366 the\n4.747366 5.238834 time\n</code></pre> and then we build the SMIL file with some GREP, giving us this: <pre><code>&lt;smil xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/SMIL\" xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" version=\"3.0\"&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;seq id=\"s000001\" epub:textref=\"dream-05.xhtml\"&gt;\n&lt;par id=\"par1\"&gt;\n&lt;text src=\"dream-05.xhtml#_idTextSpan207\"/&gt;\n&lt;audio src=\"audio/act1scene1_clip01.mp3\" clipBegin=\"0.000000s\" clipEnd=\"2.214817s\" /&gt;\n&lt;/par&gt;\n&lt;par id=\"par2\"&gt;\n&lt;text src=\"dream-05.xhtml#_idTextSpan208\"/&gt;\n&lt;audio src=\"audio/act1scene1_clip01.mp3\" clipBegin=\"2.214817s\" clipEnd=\"4.062584s\" /&gt;\n&lt;/par&gt;\n&lt;par id=\"par3\"&gt;\n&lt;text src=\"dream-05.xhtml#_idTextSpan209\"/&gt;\n&lt;audio src=\"audio/act1scene1_clip01.mp3\" clipBegin=\"4.062584s\" clipEnd=\"6.006284s\" /&gt;\n&lt;/par&gt;\n&lt;par id=\"par4\"&gt;\n&lt;text src=\"dream-05.xhtml#_idTextSpan210\"/&gt;\n&lt;audio src=\"audio/act1scene1_clip01.mp3\" clipBegin=\"6.006284s\" clipEnd=\"7.403579s\" /&gt;\n&lt;/par&gt;\n&lt;/seq&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/smil&gt;\n</code></pre>","tags":["ebookproduction","indesign","multimedia"]},{"location":"eBookProduction/Enhancing-an-eBook/#additions-to-the-package-file-contentopf","title":"Additions to the package file (content.opf)","text":"<p>We now need to make changes and additions to the content.opf file.

For print book designers who have placed text boxes here and there throughout the document, without anchoring them or threading them into the main story, I have to say, you will struggle to get a good ePub from InDesign. Change your approach. Anchor those text boxes at the appropriate places in the main text, but please get out of the habit of creating headings with separate text boxes and drag/dropping them onto the page. This simply has to stop! Include the text in the structure. Not only will this give the better ePub results, but you also need to think about the table of contents (next section).</p> <p>Conclusion: Text threading and structure of content does impact significantly on the resulting ePubs. Do try to keep your text threading simple with objects anchored inside those text frames. Multiple stories are possible, and you can use these stories as a way of ordering your 'articles' - which in turn can be used as the Content Order when exporting.

The standard is open and anyone can create software that will read and display the ePub.</p> <p>The specification was originally in use as version 2 (ePub2) and in this release books could only be re-flowable with text not formatted as is for print but more like a web page; flowing to fit the size of the device or window.</p> <p>In 2014 the ePub3 version was released and now includes the ability for content to arranged as 'fixed' or precise layout. This new format also can include 'overlays' to deliver javascript, multimedia and animation.</p> <p>In the latest version of the format ePub3, we have 2 available modes; the re-flowable and the fixed-layout forms. They are different in the amount of display control that they leave to the user/reader. Within a re-flowable eBook, the user may change the font size, the typeface and (on some devices), display features such as leading, alignment, justification and hyphenation. On the other hand, the fixed-layout form removes any such flexibility, and the page designer can arrange text and image on each page and be sure that this is how it will remain. The fixed-layout form is the friend to the graphic designer; the re-flowable form provides more accessibility for the user.</p> <p>So, in summary, the ePub can either be used to deliver re-flowable or fixed-layout content.</p> <p>The ePub file can be converted to the Kindle <code>mobi</code> format (see below), and Amazon make available tools to make this conversion relatively painless<sup>1</sup>. A good publishing strategy is to create for the ePub format first and then convert to the Kindle format from your validated ePub file.

For what it\u2019s worth though, here are my 3 points that you should consider:</p> <ul> <li>If the content is mostly text, then build as a re-flowable ePub3 (ePub2 if you want to support older devices) version and convert to mobi/kindle. This way, you get to distribute for most platforms. You can have nice typography, good table of contents with an attractive cover and chapter headings. You can use Adobe InDesign for this and by adding Amazon\u2019s free KindleGen into your toolset, you get the Kindle version too.</li> <li>If the content needs lots of illustrations, embedded in the text, with specific layout requirements (such as double page spreads, or full screen images), then you have to decide between ~~iBooks Author (simple to use free software)~~, that will only deliver to the Apple devices \u2014 or a fixed-layout ePub that has limited support on devices other than the Apple tablets, but can (with limitations) be converted to the Kindle KF8 format (for Kindle Fire). You may need to consider your existing workflow and \u2018in house\u2019 skills when making this choice. The fixed-layout ePub3 (rather than the ~~iBooks Author iBook~~) is likely to be the best choice if you are publishing to print as well as eBook from the same (InDesign) file.</li> <li>If there is a need to add significant amounts of multimedia, interactivity and even quizzes or multiple choice questions, then iBooks Author may be your best option. In a later chapter I will be looking at APP solutions such as Mag+, and HTML5/CSS/javascript frameworks, but APPs are very much tied to their target platform.

Then you need to put this on an HTML page. In other words you are creating a web page with this image displayed centrally. The image needs to be enclosed in a div that is absolutely positioned and content set to scroll horizontally.</p> <p></p><pre><code>.container { \nposition:absolute;\ntop:20%;\nwidth:100%; \noverflow-x:scroll;\n-webkit-overflow:hidden; \n-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch; \npadding:0;\nmargin:0;\nheight:363px; \n}\n</code></pre> The image itself is marked up with HTML thus: <pre><code>&lt;img src=\"images/balfourbaypano_large.jpg\" style=\"height:100%;width:3000px;\" alt=\"balfourbay\"/&gt; \n</code></pre>"},{"location":"eBooks/Memoirs%20of%20an%20Islet/#pictures","title":"Pictures","text":"<p>Images that relate to the text are set to float to the right together with their captions. This is achieved by including the img tag and the caption inside a block element. Only the width of the image is specified in the mark-up, and this is set to 100%. The containing block, however, is styled to be set to 35%. This means that the image and caption will reduce when the width of the display is reduced. This seems to work well in Adobe Digital Editions as well as iBooks.</p>"},{"location":"eBooks/Memoirs%20of%20an%20Islet/#specifics-for-ibooks","title":"Specifics for iBooks","text":"<p>The iBook interface allows for image enlargement by double tap so there are some things to consider:</p> <ul> <li>the double tap will display the whole image</li> <li>if the image is smaller than 658 x 860 then it will be centred with white space around</li> <li>larger than 658 x 860, there will be no cropping, and it will resize to fit but maintaining the proportions of the image</li> <li>I guess the trick is to keep an image as large as possible but with the view to overall file size of the ebook.
